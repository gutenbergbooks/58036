<p>The reader of this account, being of open
mind and charitable disposition, as good men
and women have ever been, will readily recognize
that whatever may appear in these pages
to the discredit of millers in times past cannot
be taken to reflect in any fashion upon the present
master of Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s windmill. Indeed, the age-old
repute of the calling is as distasteful to him and his colleagues
of today as it would be inappropriate if applied to
them.</p>
<p>Unhappily, it cannot be denied that millers of an earlier
day&mdash;those of Chaucer&rsquo;s generation, for example&mdash;left something
to be desired in the way of scruple. That gifted storyteller
and honest reporter of the age in which he lived gave
prominent place in his <i>Canterbury Tales</i> to two millers.
One of these was the villain and ultimate victim in the
Reeve&rsquo;s Tale: &ldquo;A thief he was, forsooth, of corn and meal;
And sly at that, accustomed well to steal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other miller of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> was himself one
of the pilgrims, as merry and uncouth a rogue as one could
find in any band of cathedral-bound penitents: &ldquo;He could
steal corn and full thrice charge his tolls; and yet he had a
thumb of gold, begad.&rdquo; That last remark, an allusion to
the proverb that &ldquo;every honest miller has a thumb of gold,&rdquo;
cut a broad swath indeed. Only Chaucer&rsquo;s own regard for
truth could have moved him thus to dignify the popular
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
belief that among millers integrity was as rare as twenty-four-carat
thumbs.</p>
<p>Similar distrust can be discerned in early feudal and manorial
laws in England, which prescribed certain methods of
operation for grist millers and established corresponding
penalties for violation. The miller was directed to charge
specified tolls for his services, and no more. The lord of the
manor got his grain ground &ldquo;hopper free,&rdquo; since he generally
owned the mill and held the local milling monopoly. Under
the thirteenth-century Statute of Bakers, chartered land-holders
paid the miller one-twentieth of the grain he ground
for them, and tenants-at-will gave one-sixteenth, while
bondsmen and laborers had to part with one-twelfth of what
they brought to the mill.</p>
<p>The same law also required that the miller&rsquo;s &ldquo;toll-fat&rdquo;
(or dish) and &ldquo;sceppum&rdquo; (or scoop) used to measure grain
be accurate. The manorial seal on a measure testified that
it had been compared with the standard measure and found
exact. But millers in all lands and times (the present excepted,
of course) have been adept at finding ways to outwit
law and customer at the same time.</p>
<p>A method popular among some millers was to build square
housings for the millstones, thus providing four innocent
corners in which quite a bit of meal could collect. The more
artful members of the craft built a concealed spout that carried
a small proportion of the meal to a private bin while
the visible spout delivered the bulk of it to the customer&rsquo;s
container.</p>
<p>Other stratagems, too varied and too numerous to list
here, testify to the craftiness of many millers. The lengths
to which the law went in trying to keep up can be seen in an
English statute of 1648. This law, closing one loophole
through which a miller could levy a hidden toll, allowed him
to keep no hogs, ducks, or geese in the neighborhood of the
mill, and no more than three hens and a cock.</p>
<p>All of this ingenuity, most of the popular suspicions of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
milling craft, and some of the legal restrictions consequent
upon both, crossed the Atlantic along with the millers and
millwrights who came to the colonies. More details of this
in a moment; meantime, what of the mill that belonged to
the man that owned the name of rascal?</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">

<p class="pcap"><i>Some simple grist mills: (A) stone mortar and pestle; (B) saddlestone and
metate; (C) sappling-and-stump type of mortar and pestle, often used by early
colonists; (D) Roman quern.</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>THE OLD MILL STREAM OF HISTORY</i></span></h2>
<p>For uncounted generations in every pre-mechanical civilization
grain has been ground in a variety of one-woman-power
devices. Pounding with mortar and pestle was one
of the earliest and is still the crudest of these devices. The
saddlestone-metate device, still to be seen in some areas of
Central and South America, substituted a rolling, sliding
motion to the upper stone that rubbed and sheared the grain.
Finally, the Roman quern, rotating continually in the same
direction and shearing the kernels between grooved faces
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
of matched stones, opened the door to the use of natural
instead of muscle power.</p>
<p>History does not record the name of the man, probably a
Greek, who first harnessed natural power to grind grain
between opposing stones. Possibly it happened when his
wife handed him the family quern with the command,
&ldquo;Here, you do it!&rdquo;&mdash;in Greek, of course. What he did, instead
of earning his bread by the sweat of his brow, was to
apply brain power. He fixed a water wheel to the lower end
of a vertical shaft and attached the upper end to the upper
stone of his handmill. And then, no doubt, he went fishing
in the millstream while the flowing water did his work.</p>
<p>In the anonymous Greek&rsquo;s footsteps, a Roman named
Vitruvius made the arrangement more flexible by introducing
wooden gearing to transmit the power. Others made
further improvements in the slow progress of time until the
watermill was a reasonably efficient and widely used machine.
The Domesday Book, or census of the year 1080,
recorded 5,624 mills in England alone, all operated either
by animal or water power.</p>
<p>The identity of the man or men who invented the windmill
is also lost in the mists of antiquity&mdash;or at least of the
Middle Ages. The earliest authenticated reference to a windmill
in western Europe refers to one that stood in France
about the year 1180. The next known reference dates from
1191 and concerns a windmill in England. Both were post
mills, more or less like the reconstructed windmill of William
Robertson in Williamsburg. This is the simplest among
several types of wind-operated mills and was the type first
adopted in Europe, in England generally, and in the colonies.</p>
<p>Anyone who has read much poetry cannot fail to realize
that a watermill is by nature a more romantic machine than
a windmill. Poets recognize this as a fact, and perhaps non-poets
who have spent some well remembered moments down
by the old mill stream will agree. But this is not to say
that windmills are lacking in emotional appeal and romantic
inspiration. Far from it. As Robert Louis Stevenson wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are few merrier spectacles than that of many
windmills bickering together in a breeze over a woody
country, their halting alacrity of movement, their pleasant
business of making bread all day with uncouth gesticulations,
their air gigantically human, as of a creature
half alive, put a spirit of romance into the tame landscape.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<p class="pcap"><i>One of the earliest medieval illustrations of a windmill in England is this brass
plaque (here redrawn) in St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church, King&rsquo;s Lynn, Norfolk. It tells
the ancient joke on the good farmer riding to the mill: To relieve his tired horse
of the burden, he carried the sack of grain on his own back! Note that the mill was
a post mill and that it was slightly head sick.</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>PUTTING THE WIND TO WORK</i></span></h2>
<p>A post mill, as its name suggests, perches somewhat like
a flagpole-sitter on the end of a sturdy post held upright by
a timber framework. The Laws of Oleron, a breezily worded
maritime code adopted in England about 1314, stated that
&ldquo;some windmills are altogether held above ground, and have
a high ladder; some have their foot in the ground, being, as
people say, well affixed.&rdquo; In the latter case the substructure
of timber bracing was not above ground, but was buried
in a mound of earth.</p>
<p>The comparison to a flagpole-sitter is perhaps misleading,
for the post does not end where the mill house begins.
Rather, it enters the body of the mill through a loose fitting
collar beneath the lower floor and extends about half-way
up into the mill, where it ends in a pivot bearing. The entire
weight of the mill&mdash;sails, body, millstones, shafts, gears,
grain, meal, and miller (to say nothing of the mill cat, kittens,
and resident mice)&mdash;rests on this single bearing at the
top of the great post.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Keeping so much weight in stable balance was no great
problem for the millwright as long as the mill did not move.
The collar or ring bearing around the post kept the body
from tipping far in any direction&mdash;or was supposed to.
Moreover, the millwright estimated the weights of the various
elements and positioned them appropriately about the
pivot. Of course, things sometimes came out wrong. A
mill that tipped incurably forward was called &ldquo;head sick&rdquo;;
one that always tipped backward was &ldquo;tail sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the mill was in motion the matter of stability became
a good deal more complicated. For various reasons,
including aerodynamic and gyroscopic effects that the early
millwrights sensed but did not fully understand, the balance
of a windmill is different in operation than at rest.
The successful millwright, therefore, needed an accumulation
of trial-and-error knowledge that might go back for
generations.</p>
<p>The result, even though most everything but the millstones
was of wood, was a surprisingly stable and exceedingly
durable structure. A post mill built in Lincolnshire,
England, in 1509 was still in operation in 1909! And although
any storm might leave tragedy in its wake, post
mills toppled over less often than their precarious position
and top-heavy appearance would seem to promise. In this
respect the Williamsburg mill is doubly guarded, being
equipped with removable metal braces and buried ground
anchors for use in the event a hurricane is predicted. This
adaptation, to be sure, is a twentieth-century safety measure,
not an eighteenth-century custom.</p>
<p>The problem of balance, and the related difficulty of
maneuvering a post mill to face the wind because its whole
weight is focused on the one bearing, generally limited such
mills to one or two pairs of stones. Some English post mills
had three pairs and a few even four. But these exceptions
demonstrate the limitations of the post mill and the reasons
for development of its successor, the tower mill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The purpose in this development was to transfer weight
from the pivoted upper portion of the mill to solid ground
beneath it. In the tower mill, almost the whole mill became
a firm structure. Only the cap, holding the sails and their
axle, needed to be turned to face the wind. Turning this
cap was far easier than turning the whole body of a post
mill. Small to start with, tower mills became quite large
when mechanical means were developed to adjust sail area.
The tallest English tower mills were more than one hundred
feet high at the hub of the sails, with sweeps that reached out
as much as forty feet.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;smock mill,&rdquo; common in Holland and
brought to England probably in the time of James I, is a
tower mill whose structure is framed and covered in wood
rather than built up of masonry. Examples of this variety
of mill can still be seen on Nantucket Island, Cape Cod,
Long Island, in Rhode Island, and perhaps elsewhere. The
eastern end of Long Island contains more colonial windmills
than any other part of the United States today, and all
without exception are smock mills.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>INDIAN CORN AND COLONIAL MILLS</i></span></h2>
<p>Both windmill and watermill have been intimately associated
with the development of the English colonies in
America from their earliest days. This, of course, is not
a matter of wonderment since bread was the staff of life
then even more than it is today. No doubt all the early
settlements had mortars or small hand mills, and in many
cases they also employed larger ones powered by animals.</p>
<p>The first settlers at Jamestown in 1607 brought with them
full and detailed instructions drawn up in advance by the
Virginia Company of London. The 144 men and boys were
to be divided into three working groups: one to build a
fort, storehouse, church, and dwellings; the second to clear
land and plant the wheat brought from home; and the third
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
to explore the surrounding countryside in search of the
Northwest Passage, mineral riches, or other resources that
might return dividends to the company&rsquo;s stockholders.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the planting of grain received less than
prime attention. Defense against the Indians was a more
pressing demand, and many of the gentlemen settlers were
unwilling to soil their hands with menial labor. An exploring
party, however, reported that it had observed at the falls
of the James River five or six islands &ldquo;very fitt for the
buylding of water milnes thereon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="589" />
<p class="pcap"><i>From an etching by James D. Smillie entitled &ldquo;Old
Mills, Coast of Virginia.&rdquo; The original&mdash;now in the New
York Public Library&mdash;was made in 1890, probably on
Virginia&rsquo;s Eastern Shore.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Several years seem to have passed before any mill was
built in Virginia. In 1620 the Company sent word that
it considered the construction of watermills of first importance.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
The next year it specifically instructed the colonists
to erect corn mills and bake houses in every borough.</p>
<p>Actually by 1621 the first mill had been put up by
Governor Yeardley on his own plantation near the falls
of the James River. But it was a windmill, not a watermill,
and for at least four years seems to have been the sole
facility of its kind in the whole coastal wilderness of North
America.</p>
<p>The first mill in the Massachusetts Bay colony, where
waterfalls were considerably more frequent and closer to
the coast than in tidewater Virginia, was also a windmill,
built in 1631. In New Amsterdam the first mill, again a
windmill, was erected in 1632. In Virginia by 1649 there
were nine mills in operation, four windmills and five watermills,
and the number had grown as fast or faster in other
areas.</p>
<p>Exposed coastal areas on Cape Cod, around Newport,
Rhode Island, and on the eastern end of Long Island, as
well as on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, the Carolinas,
and Virginia were found especially well adapted to windmills.
Massachusetts in particular saw a rapid rise in milling.
It was there, under the aegis of John Pearson, &ldquo;the
father of the milling industry,&rdquo; that commercial milling got
its early start in America.</p>
<p>At somewhat later stages a similar boom in milling
activity took place in New Netherland, New Sweden, and
their successor English colonies. For several decades New
York held the crown as the wheat-growing, grist-milling,
and flour-exporting capital of the New World, only to be
superseded about 1700 by Pennsylvania.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>WHERE TOBACCO WAS KING</i></span></h2>
<p>In Maryland and Virginia, where tobacco was the king-sized
money crop, grist-milling developed along a somewhat
different path. Throughout the seventeenth and well
into the eighteenth century the tobacco colonists grew
wheat and corn for home consumption only. And &ldquo;home
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
consumption&rdquo; in most instances meant literally that. The
typical plantation, an almost self-sufficient community in
many ways, raised wheat enough for the owner&rsquo;s family and
sufficient corn to feed the slaves and animals.</p>
<p>In his report of 1724, called <i>The Present State of Virginia</i>,
Hugh Jones avowed that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for grinding Corn, &amp;c. they have good mills upon
the Runs and Creeks; besides Hand-Mills, Wind-Mills,
and the Indian invention of pounding Hommony in
Mortars burnt in the Stump of a Tree, with a Log, for
a Pestle, hanging at the End of a Pole, fixed like the Pole
of a Lave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often the planter owned and operated a grist mill for his
own use and that of the neighboring small farmers. William
Fitzhugh, for example, described his fully equipped layout
as including, in 1686, &ldquo;a good water Grist miln, whose tole
I find sufficient to find my own family with wheat &amp; Indian
corn for our necessitys and occasions.&rdquo; Fitzhugh thus
needed to grow no grain of his own to feed his &ldquo;family,&rdquo; an
expression that to him included not only the white indentured
servants who lived and worked on the plantation, but
also his twenty-nine slaves.</p>
<p>Such a mill represented a considerable investment of capital,
and it was this initial cost as much as any other factor
that determined the pattern of mill ownership in Virginia.
So far as records survive to tell the story, all of the colony&rsquo;s
early mills were built on plantations, either by well-to-do
colonial officials or by syndicates of neighboring planters.
Most of these early mills, if not all of them, were built primarily
to grind the owner&rsquo;s produce. Since few but the very
largest plantations could keep a mill busy at grinding home-grown
grain, most plantation mills also did custom grinding
for nearby farmers. A mill formerly owned by John Robinson,
speaker of the House of Burgesses, collected enough toll
in this fashion to feed a &ldquo;family&rdquo; of nearly sixty persons,
plus several horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>

<p class="pcap"><i>Two tower mills and three post mills can be seen on this map, redrawn from a
&ldquo;Sketch of the East end of the Peninsula Where on is Hampton.&rdquo; On the same
peninsula, thirty miles to the northwest, lies Williamsburg. The original map is at
the University of Michigan among the papers of Sir Henry Clinton, commander-in-chief
of British forces during part of the American Revolution.</i></p>
</div>
<p>It was out of this combination plantation-custom type
of mill that the merchant mill finally developed in Virginia.
The first William Byrd was well ahead of his fellow planters
in developing milling as a business, although he lagged far
behind John Pearson of Massachusetts. In 1685 Byrd had
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
erected two water grist mills at the falls of the James
River&mdash;the very power site of which Captain Newport&rsquo;s
exploring party had remarked. He asked a friend in London
to hunt up and send over one or two honest millers to run
the mills and sent inquiries to the West Indies about selling
the flour he expected to make.</p>
<p>Despite Byrd&rsquo;s example, commercial or &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; milling,
as it was known, gained little headway in the colony
until the next century was two-thirds over. Then, when
wheat became important to the tobacco growers as a second
export crop, quite a few planters added a second pair of
stones to their mills and began shipping barrels of flour
along with hogsheads of tobacco. The additions were usually
buhr or &ldquo;burr&rdquo; stones from France, preferred for
high-quality grinding because their structure included
sharp-edged quartz cavities.</p>
<p>In 1769, for instance, George Washington rebuilt his mill
on Dogue Run near Mount Vernon, and imported French
stones to grind export flour. Robert Carter, probably
Virginia&rsquo;s wealthiest planter-businessman at the time, had
been experimenting with other crops on his tobacco-exhausted
acres and had fixed on wheat as the best substitute
for the &ldquo;Imperial weed.&rdquo; By 1772 Carter was buying wheat
in 8,000 and 10,000 bushel lots to grind in his mill near
Nomini Hall.</p>
<p>The merchant mill was not a business venture in itself,
but a facility in the business of exporting flour or supplying
ship&rsquo;s bread. The merchant miller did not make his profit
through the provision of a milling service; he actually bought
the grain and processed it on his own account, making a
profit or loss on the sale of the product. In many instances
the merchant miller not only ground wheat into flour, but
also baked the flour into bread for export&mdash;particularly in
the form of ship&rsquo;s biscuit.</p>
<p>The owner of a custom mill, on the other hand, did not
buy and sell grain at all, but found his income as a portion
or toll of the grain he milled. The pure custom mill was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
rarity in Virginia, however, being limited to a few establishments
in and around the towns of Manchester, Petersburg,
Norfolk, Alexandria, and Williamsburg.</p>
<p>A mill in Yorktown, too, was presumably of this sort.
In 1711 the owners of land on the York River just below
Yorktown Creek deeded a parcel to William Buckner for
a windmill, on condition that he &ldquo;grind for the donors
12 bbls. of Indian corn without toll.&rdquo; A view of Yorktown
drawn about 1850 shows an abandoned smock mill&mdash;very
likely the original one&mdash;standing lonely and forlorn on the
hill in question.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>HOW WAS IT IN WILLIAMSBURG?</i></span></h2>
<p>Very little information about milling in Williamsburg has
survived from colonial days&mdash;or at any rate has been unearthed
by diligent research. We do know that Williamsburg
was considered to offer many choice locations, and that
several mills were erected in the town or in its immediate
vicinity before the Revolution. As far back as 1699, when
the burgesses were thinking of moving the capital from
Jamestown to Middle Plantation (as Williamsburg was then
named), a student of the College of William and Mary
extolled the proposed site in a formal speech, one of several
made to an audience that included the governor and his
council as well as the burgesses.</p>
<p>The college itself was already located at Middle Plantation,
on the ridge between the James and York rivers and
with creeks flowing to each. In the words of the student
orator, &ldquo;The neighbourhood of these two brave creeks gives
an Opportunity of making as many water mills as a good
Town can have occasion for, and the highness of the land
affords great conveniency for as many Wind mills as can
ever be wanting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the known watermills lay outside the corporate limits
of the city. The nearest, apparently, was a paper mill
built by William Parks, founder of the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>,
and described by him as &ldquo;The first Mill of the Kind, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
ever was erected in this Colony.&rdquo; It stood about a half-mile
south of town on a stream that is known to this day as
&ldquo;Paper Mill Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he married the rich Widow Custis, George Washington
became the owner of two plantations close to Williamsburg
and a water grist mill not three miles from the town.
Samuel Coke, the Williamsburg silversmith, owned a grist
mill, also water powered, less than one mile away.</p>
<p>What information we have concerning
Williamsburg windmills is limited
to three fragmentary items. First, in
1723 William Robertson, clerk of the
General Assembly, holder of a number
of other government offices, lawyer,
and land speculator, deeded to John
Holloway four lots in Williamsburg,
&ldquo;being the lots whereon the said William
Robertson&rsquo;s wind mill stands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="302" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Post mill symbol, redrawn
and enlarged, from
the &ldquo;Frenchman&rsquo;s Map&rdquo;
of Williamsburg, 1782.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Second, during the Revolution an
American soldier who kept a diary of
his experiences mentioned being &ldquo;near the windmill, in
Williamsburgh&rdquo; one night before the siege of Yorktown.</p>
<p>Finally, an unknown French mapmaker, presumed to be
in the service of Rochambeau, drew a very careful and
complete billeting map of Williamsburg and the buildings in
it. On this map appears a representation of a post mill just
on the southern edge of the town.</p>
<p>Beyond these three items the story of milling in Williamsburg
has to rest on careful deduction, the cross checking
of every pertinent fact, the following of every lead, the
consultation of every source&mdash;in sum, on a mass of research.</p>
<p>For example, evidence as to how the Williamsburg windmills
functioned has long since disappeared. Because Robertson&rsquo;s
mill was within the city, however, it can be said
with reasonable certainty that it operated as a custom mill,
not a plantation mill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>MILLING AND THE VIRGINIA PLANTERS</i></span></h2>
<p>If not much is now known about milling within the confines
of Williamsburg itself, a great deal can be related of
milling in the larger expanse of the Virginia colony. For
despite the late start of merchant milling in the tobacco
colonies, the grinding of grain for export had become big
business by the time of the Revolution. In 1766 Governor
Fauquier noted in a report to the Board of Trade (albeit
almost as an afterthought) that the Virginians &ldquo;daily set
up mills to grind their wheat into flour for exportation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such merchant mills, as advertisements in the <i>Virginia
Gazette</i> attest, were usually connected with a plantation.
Advertisements for the lease or sale of other farm property
repeatedly contained the phrase &ldquo;convenient to church and
mills.&rdquo; A mill scheduled to be built near Robert Carter&rsquo;s
on Nomini Creek&mdash;too near, he thought&mdash;would be the
twenty-fourth within twelve miles on the Virginia side of the
Potomac, an area that included no towns.</p>
<p>Carter&rsquo;s &ldquo;new mill,&rdquo; completed in 1773, had a capacity of
25,000 bushels a year and cost him &pound;1,450 in materials and
wages. Carter also built in connection with the mill a bake
house, the two ovens of which would bake one hundred
pounds of flour at each heating. And he hired a cooper to &ldquo;get
up 10 good flower caskes per day&rdquo; at an annual salary of &pound;30.</p>
<p>Carter estimated his total outlay to keep the mill running
at &pound;5,000 per year, but the return was correspondingly great.
The mill was a success from the start, and the Revolution
soon added to its importance and its business. For several
months in 1780 the mill worked eighteen hours a day grinding
for the state, and Carter received six bushels of corn a
day in toll. After 1785, however, Carter found it unprofitable
to work the mill himself, and leased it to other operators.</p>
<p>Although on a smaller scale, George Washington also engaged
in merchant milling. His Dogue Run mill, formerly
a plantation mill only, was rebuilt in 1769 as a merchant
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
mill. He installed a pair of French burr stones to grind the
export flour, while a pair of Cologne stones did the country
work and ground Washington&rsquo;s own crops. Washington
also provided a nearby dwelling house and garden for the
miller and his family, who could raise chickens for their own
table but never for sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole of my Force,&rdquo; Washington wrote in 1774,
&ldquo;is in a manner confind to the growth of Wheat and Manufacturing
of it into Flour.&rdquo; Some of the wheat he proposed
to sell in London if the price were right, if the freight and
commission charges were not too high, and &ldquo;if our Commerce
with Great Britain is kept open (which seems to be a
matter of great doubt at present).&rdquo; He did ship some flour
directly to the West Indies but disposed of most of his
&ldquo;superfine flour of the first quality&rdquo; through merchants in
Norfolk and Alexandria.</p>
<p>Washington, like Carter and other Virginia merchant
millers, felt the loss of West Indian markets after the Revolution.
But he continued his interest in milling into the
better times that followed the establishment of a stable
national government. Washington, in fact, received one of
the first licenses to use the milling improvements invented
by the Delaware millwright, Oliver Evans. As late as 1799,
the year of his death, he wrote that &ldquo;as a farmer, Wheat
and Flour constitute my principal Concerns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a millowner, one of Washington&rsquo;s chief worries seems
to have been very much the same as that of William Byrd
a century earlier, namely, to obtain the services of an honest
and diligent miller to operate his mill. The problem had
faced Robert Carter, too, who sent inquiries as far as New
Jersey. That other Virginia planter-entrepreneurs faced
the same challenge is apparent in many advertisements in
the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> of the time.</p>
<p>When Washington rebuilt the Dogue Run mill, he was
fortunate in hiring William Roberts as miller. Not only
was Roberts an honest man in his employer&rsquo;s opinion, but
also a highly capable miller. Washington gave him full
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
credit for the fact that flour from Dogue Run commanded
top prices in Alexandria and the West Indies markets.</p>
<p>For several years the arrangement was ideal. Then
Roberts grew more and more interested in a wheat product
other than flour. By 1783 he had become such a drunken
sot that the squire of Mount Vernon began seeking a replacement,
only to relent when the miller promised to reform
his ways. However, this pledge, like its predecessors,
soon dissolved in alcohol, and Washington finally fired
Roberts.</p>
<p>A substitute, Joseph Davenport by name, was lured from
Pennsylvania but turned out to be an inferior miller and as
slothful as Roberts had been unreliable. Even so, Washington
tolerated him until Davenport&rsquo;s death in 1796. His
successor, Callahan, was a competent miller but again far
from industrious, and demanded higher wages than the mill
could support. In desperation, Washington hunted up
Roberts and offered to rehire him on condition of &ldquo;a solemn
and fixed determination to refrain from liquor.&rdquo; This arrangement
fell through&mdash;perhaps Roberts celebrated too
heartily&mdash;and the President finally leased the mill to his
overseer, James Anderson.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>ALL THAT THE LAW ALLOWS</i></span></h2>
<p>It was said earlier that legal restrictions on milling crossed
the Atlantic along with the jolly practitioners of that craft.
Indeed, the history of milling in the colonies is fully punctuated
by the regular passage or amendment of laws to
&ldquo;rectifie the great abuse of millers,&rdquo; as the first such law
in Virginia put it. This first Virginia law appeared as early
as 1645 and fixed the allowable toll at a generous one-sixth.
Such a law had been passed ten years earlier in the Massachusetts
Bay colony.</p>
<p>In neither colony, however, did the law seem to be effective
without frequent amendment. The Massachusetts General
Court repassed and strengthened its regulation five
separate times in thirty years; the Virginia burgesses acted
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
the same number of times in an even shorter period. A
prohibition against taking excessive toll and the setting of
penalties and fines for violation figured in every revision
of the Virginia law throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. The basic regulation, passed in 1705, provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That all millers shall grind according to turn; and shall
well and sufficiently grind the grain brought to their
mills; and shall take no more for toll or grinding, than
one eighth part of wheat, and one sixth part of Indian
corn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other phases of governmental interest in grist milling
involved the exercise of the right of eminent domain to provide
watermill sites; the requirement that roads be established
and maintained leading to mills; that mill dams be
wide enough at the top for a carriage way, include locks for
navigation and fish slopes if necessary, and not be built
above or too close below an existing dam; the inspection of
flour to assure uniformly high quality, free from impurities;
the requirement that millers have and use measures
tested for accuracy; and so on. From such legislation it
will be seen that milling, ostensibly a purely private venture,
partook strongly of the nature of a public utility.</p>
<p>In view of the mill&rsquo;s vital importance to the community,
as revealed in this legislative history, it is no surprise to
learn that the miller was considered essential too. Along
with certain officials of the colony, clergymen, plantation
overseers, the gaoler, schoolmasters, and some other groups
deemed necessary to orderly civil life, millers were exempt
from service in the militia. Furthermore, since militia
musters were often occasions of prolonged revelry, any
miller who &ldquo;shall presume to appear at any muster&rdquo; was
to be fined one hundred pounds of tobacco or be &ldquo;tied Neck
and Heels&rdquo; for up to twenty minutes. Only when the need for
foot soldiers became all-consuming in 1780 was the militia
exemption lifted. Until then the miller was expected, and
obliged, to keep his nose to the millstone.</p>

</div>
<p>The miller, thus, seems to have had a split personality&mdash;at
least in the public mind. On the one hand he possessed
an ancient reputation for dishonesty that called for repeated
legislative curbs and punishments. On the other
hand, he was so indispensable to community welfare that
the law got after him if he took a day off for public carousing
as other men did.</p>
<p>At least since Greek and Roman times the miller, who
performed a task once relegated to women and slaves, was
traditionally held in low esteem by reason of his calling.
Yet some colonial millers were respected and influential men,
and sometimes men of substance. John Jenny built the
windmill in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1636 and was
chosen by his fellow townsmen to represent them in the
General Court. Two years later he was indicted for failing
to grind his neighbor&rsquo;s grain well and seasonably. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
nearby town of Rehoboth similarly elected its miller to the
General Court. But he refused to leave his mill in order to
serve as deputy and was fined!</p>
<p>In colonial Virginia the social position of the miller was
less subject to violent fluctuation than would seem to have
been the case in New England. In fact, the Virginia miller
was uniformly a man of low estate, far inferior to the owner-operator
of a mill in a New England town, and outranked
also by the sturdy bourgeois millers of the middle colonies.
Those who worked for wages enjoyed few privileges, while
the many Virginia millers who were either Negro slaves or
white indentured servants had little social standing. The
records contain a goodly number of references to runaway
millers who were indentured servants, convict servants, or
slaves; if any Virginia miller in colonial times rose to a
position of importance, no record has yet been found.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>THE SAID WILLIAM ROBERTSON&rsquo;S WIND MILL ...</i></span></h2>
<p>Most windmills belonged to one or other of the two basic
categories: post mill or tower mill. The truth of this general
rule is easily proved by the exception&mdash;the composite
mill that belonged to neither group, but was in effect a
post mill set on top of a tower. Another truism&mdash;perhaps
without any exception&mdash;states that since every mill was
custom designed and made by hand, no two were exactly
alike.</p>
<p>Every English and colonial millwright had his favorite
tricks of design and construction, and often the mills of a
region showed a family resemblance that distinguished them
from the mills of the neighboring shire or colony. In addition,
improvements and refinements were developed from
time to time and gradually put into use. Many of them,
like the grain elevating machinery invented by Oliver Evans
of Delaware and the adjustable lattice sails of the English
inventor Sir William Cubbitt, came long after 1716-1723,
the years during which Robertson&rsquo;s original mill was built.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Clearly, this is not the place in which to describe the
almost infinite variety in structure and operation of windmills
in different places and at succeeding stages in the perfection
of the mill as a machine. A list of a few easily procured
books appears on <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a> for those who wish to pursue
the subject further. This little pamphlet must be limited to
a description of the reconstructed mill in Williamsburg and
how it operates.</p>
<p>First, a word needs to be said about the men behind
the mill, Edward P. Hamilton, former director of historic
Fort Ticonderoga, New York, and Rex Wailes, then of
London, who were Colonial Williamsburg&rsquo;s consultants in
the careful process of design and construction. Mr. Wailes,
a world authority on mills and milling machinery, furnished
information on all phases of the use of windmills in England,
and in particular provided measured drawings of a seventeenth-century
mill still standing at Bourn in Cambridgeshire.
Mr. Hamilton carried on from there. By vocation
an investment counselor (retired) and by avocation a collector
of watch and clock mechanisms, an authority on
windmills in America, and a skilled model builder, he transformed
the drawings into miniature reality, creating a
perfect working model in which every part performs the
function assigned to its larger counterpart in the mill
itself.</p>
<p>William Robertson, who sold to John Holloway in 1723
four lots near the Palace &ldquo;whereon the said William Robertson&rsquo;s
wind mill stands,&rdquo; was not a miller. Neither was
Holloway. The records left by both men provide no clue
as to the exact appearance of the mill in question. In fact,
the deed to the land itself did not give any more precise
location for the mill.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of the mill, therefore, had to depend on
answers to two questions: Just where did Robertson&rsquo;s
windmill originally stand? and What kind of a mill was it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="641" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Robertson&rsquo;s Windmill, a faithfully authenticated post mill, stands in Williamsburg today on a
spot near the Governor&rsquo;s Palace where its predecessor is believed to have stood about 1720.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>By eliminating every other possibility, the site of the
lots was established with certainty at the corner of North
England and Scotland streets. By elimination again, the
spot where the mill must have stood was placed at or near
the present site&mdash;simply because other buildings were known
to occupy various other locations in the tract. Thorough
archeological excavation of the whole area, however, disclosed
no corroborative evidence to show the precise location
of the mill.</p>
<p>At the same time, the absence of such evidence was itself
almost conclusive evidence that the mill was a post mill
such as were common in tidewater Virginia at that time.
A tower mill, which was the second variety often built
hereabouts in colonial days, would have had foundations
in the ground. Traces of these would have been revealed
by digging at the site. Since none of the foundations excavated
in the four lots was suitable to the underpinning of a
tower mill&mdash;ergo the mill must have been supported above
ground on a wooden post.</p>
<p>And so it was rebuilt: a small post mill, simple in design
and operation, with but a single pair of millstones.
The tail pole, extending to the rear, ends in a wagon-wheel
support that eases the miller&rsquo;s task of turning the mill by
hand to face the wind. Other millers sometimes had shoulder
yokes attached to the tail pole, or pulled it around
with the help of a small winch anchored to one of a circle
of posts.</p>
<p>The stairway from the ground up to the body of the mill,
called the &ldquo;ladder,&rdquo; is hinged at the upper end so that
when the mill is to be turned, a lever raises the foot of the
ladder off the ground. When the mill has been positioned
to face the wind, the end of the ladder is lowered to the
ground again where it helps hold the mill against further
turning.</p>
<p>Beneath the body of the mill are the heavy timbers on
which it rests: the horizontal &ldquo;crosstrees,&rdquo; the sloping
&ldquo;quarterbars,&rdquo; and the great post, all hand hewn of well-seasoned
oak. The tree from which the post is hewn was
itself young when Williamsburg first became the colonial
capital. A count of its annual rings shows it to have been
a sapling in 1675, which makes it one of the town&rsquo;s oldest
&ldquo;antiques.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>

<p class="pcap"><i>An eighteenth-century cutaway drawing, from Diderot&rsquo;s great French encyclopedia, showing
the structure and mechanism of a post mill. The artist has &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; the body of the mill a few
feet off the post to reveal the pivot bearing on which the massive crowntree would in fact rest.
Note also the power takeoff from the brake wheel for the sack hoist.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Mounting the ladder and looking into the mill&rsquo;s lower or
&ldquo;meal floor,&rdquo; we see that the post ends in a wrought-iron
bearing set into another beam of impressive size that
&ldquo;crosses&rdquo; the post like the top of a giant &ldquo;T.&rdquo; This beam
is the &ldquo;crowntree,&rdquo; on which the framework of the mill
body is built. Below the lower floor is another bearing or
loose collar around the post to keep the body steady on
its perch.</p>
<p>The primary machinery of the mill consists of sails, stones,
and the necessary shafts and gearwheels to transmit power
from the sails to the stones. In addition, there are devices
for braking the sails, for hoisting bags of grain from the
ground to the upper or &ldquo;stone floor,&rdquo; for feeding grain at
the proper speed to the stones, for warning the miller when
the supply of grain in the hopper is getting low, for adjusting
the distance between stones, and for separating the
meal from the bran.</p>
<p>The sails of the Williamsburg mill are of the early pattern
in which the backbone of each sail frame extends along the
centerline of the sail. That is, the area of sail ahead of
the backbone&mdash;in the direction of turning&mdash;is the same as
the area following it. Incidentally, windmill sails usually
turn counterclockwise (viewed from in front of the mill).</p>
<p>The sailcloths themselves are handmade, of imported
Scottish linen. To meet changes of weather they are furled
by hand, each arm in turn being stopped at the lowest
position while the miller unties the outward corners and
twists the long strip into a more or less tight roll. For
this purpose he can set and release the brake from the
ground, using the rope that hangs out the side of the mill.</p>
<p>Whereas each sailcloth of Robertson&rsquo;s windmill must
be wholly furled or not trimmed at all, the sails of many
early mills could be partially reefed. The four degrees of
reefing were known as full sail, first reef, dagger point,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
and sword point. Trimming the sails was a difficult and
sometimes dangerous task, for a sudden storm with sleet
and shifting gusts of wind could make the job almost impossible
at the very moment that it had to be accomplished
quickly. A miller caught with his sails up in such a storm
might suffer what was known as &ldquo;tail winding&rdquo; if the wind
veered faster than he could work. In this event he might
be lucky to get off with nothing worse than having the sailcloth
stripped from the frame.</p>
<p>A hurricane could do more serious damage&mdash;and might
overturn the whole mill&mdash;no matter which way it faced.
For the wind was the miller&rsquo;s master as well as his servant,
an evil genius that he feared as well as a heavenly blessing
for which he prayed. Without wind the mill stood idle and
the miller earned nothing. When the wind arose the miller
must heed its call to work, whether in the middle of a meal
or in the middle of the night. And always, he must keep
a weather eye on the horizon for signs of too much wind.</p>
<p>Fire and lightning were other great perils to every windmill.
If the hopper ran empty of grain, the friction of the
stones rubbing against one another could generate enough
heat for combustion. So could the friction of the brake if
it were used continuously in a strong wind. In either event,
a building made entirely of wood and open to every breeze
burned readily, and more windmills probably fell victim to
fire and storm than to old age. Similarly, its height and
exposed position made the windmill an attractive target for
lightning.</p>
<p>The sail wheel of the Williamsburg mill has a diameter of
fifty-two feet&mdash;about average for a small post mill of this
type. In a wind of about twenty miles an hour, which seems
to be generally best for windmill operations, it will turn at
about twenty revolutions per minute. This apparently
slow and majestic rate is deceptive; for at twenty rpm the
tips of the sails travel at a linear speed of 3,266 feet a
minute or about thirty-seven miles an hour! An operating
windmill is something to stay well clear of, as Don Quixote
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
and uncounted innocently grazing cows and sheep have
discovered to their sorrow.</p>
<p>The four arms are fixed into the hub of the massive
&ldquo;windshaft.&rdquo; This is the main horizontal axle that brings
the power of the turning sails into the mill. Actually, it
is not exactly horizontal but slants at a ten-degree angle.
Since the wind has always been thought to descend from
heaven, this ancient arrangement may at one time have
been intended to let the sail wheel &ldquo;look up&rdquo; a bit into the
wind. It has, in any case, both structural and aerodynamic
advantages.</p>
<p>Just inside the front wall of the mill the windshaft rests
in a metal bearing, and next to it is the large gear wheel,
known as the &ldquo;brake wheel,&rdquo; that can be seen when one
looks up through the trap door from the mill&rsquo;s little back
platform. The platform, incidentally, was not unusual in
post mills, although it was often a convenience added after
the mill was built and on which the miller could enjoy a pipe
and a moment of repose while the mill ground merrily away.</p>
<p>The brake wheel, a little more than seven feet in diameter,
is firmly fixed to the windshaft and turns at the same speed
as the sails. Its fifty-one hickory gear teeth and eighteen
other major pieces, plus at least as many wooden pegs to
hold the pieces together, were all carefully shaped and fitted
together by hand. Around its outer edge is the brake band&mdash;of
bent hickory&mdash;that can stop the sails and hold them at
any position when the long, heavy brake lever is lowered. As
an emergency aid in slowing down the sails in a strong wind,
the stones can be choked with grain, thus making them
harder to turn. The mill can also be operated with partially
furled sails.</p>
<p>The stones themselves consist of the lower or &ldquo;bed stone,&rdquo;
which does not move, and the upper or &ldquo;runner stone,&rdquo;
which turns at a little more than five times the rate of the
sails. Its normal speed for best results is 108 revolutions
per minute, at which speed it produces five to ten pounds
of meal per minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="607" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Another engraving from Diderot&rsquo;s encyclopedia showing
the passage of grain from hopper to millstones, and
its reappearance as meal. Notice the arrangement to set
the bell ringing when the hopper is about empty and
the weighted lever at the left by which the miller can
control the distance between the millstones.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The cogs of the brake wheel stay in constant mesh with
the staves of a sort of wooden-bird-cage gear called a
&ldquo;wallower.&rdquo; This is fixed to the upper end of the wrought-iron
vertical drive shaft, whose lower end stands in the
center or &ldquo;eye&rdquo; of the runner stone and turns it.</p>
<p>This simple drive mechanism is complicated by the fact
that the runner stone must be held suspended above the
bed stone. Ideally, the faces of the two stones&mdash;however
close together&mdash;should never touch. To accomplish this,
the runner stone is balanced to turn freely on the point of
a spindle that comes up from below through the eye of the
bed stone. The spindle, in turn, rests at its lower end in a
pivot bearing that can be raised or lowered very slightly by a
series of levers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>By this means the miller can adjust the distance between
stones according to the kind of grain he is grinding and
also according to the speed at which his mill is operating.
In a variable wind, for instance, he may have to make the
adjustment continuously as the feel of the meal coming from
the stone indicates.</p>
<p>The faces of both stones must be &ldquo;dressed&rdquo; periodically&mdash;perhaps
once every ten days when the mill is in constant
operation. For this the runner stone must be removed and
turned over so that the stone dresser, with his pickaxe-like
&ldquo;millbill,&rdquo; can operate on both faces. The dresser deepens
the furrows, if necessary, and roughens the &ldquo;lands&rdquo; between
the furrows toward the outer edges of the stones.</p>
<p>When the stones are in good condition, the grain kernels
are opened out near the eye of the stones, gradually reduced
in the middle area, and the bran scraped and cleaned in
the outer one-third of the face. The condition of the bran
is the best index of the stone dressing, while the feel of the
meal tells the miller whether his mill is running at the best
speed and if the stones are set at the proper distance apart.</p>
<p>French burr stones produced the best quality flour in
colonial mills, and most Virginia mills that ground for export
seem to have had a pair of them. Cologne, or &ldquo;cullin,&rdquo;
stones from the Rhine were somewhat less choice, and the
same mills often had a pair of these for country work,
especially for grinding corn. Stones quarried in Virginia,
Pennsylvania, New York, and elsewhere were also used.
The pair in the Williamsburg mill are of quartz-bearing
granite quarried in Rowan County, North Carolina. They
are four and one-half feet in diameter. The bed stone is
seven inches thick and the runner stone ten inches. Together
they weigh more than two tons.</p>
<p>Although colonial millers ground all varieties of grain
between the same set of stones&mdash;making only the necessary
adjustment in distance between the stones&mdash;Robertson&rsquo;s
windmill today processes only corn. But whatever the
grain, the difference of a newspaper&rsquo;s thickness makes the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
difference between a good grind and a poor one. So for all
its clumsiness in appearance and lumbering clatter in operation,
the windmill is an extremely precise mechanism at the
point where precision counts.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="367" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The stone dresser often steadied his forearm on a sack of meal as he worked.
His hands were constantly bombarded with bits of stone and slivers of metal from
the point of his pick or &ldquo;millbill.&rdquo; Some of these slivers became imbedded under
the skin, and an itinerant stone dresser looking for work could prove his experience
by &ldquo;showing his metal,&rdquo; i.e., the backs of his hands.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The grain, raised bag by bag through trapdoors on a
rope sack hoist, is poured into a hopper above the stones,
which are themselves entirely enclosed in an octagonal
wooden box called the &ldquo;stone casing&rdquo; or &ldquo;vat.&rdquo; Suspended
from the bottom of the hopper, an inclined trough or &ldquo;shoe&rdquo;
carries the grain to the central opening of the runner stone.
The turning of the drive shaft constantly joggles the shoe,
and by raising or lowering one end of it the miller can
regulate the flow of grain to the stones.</p>
<p>The grain is ground as it works its way outward between
the stones. At the outer edge of the bed stone the meal
falls into the narrow space between the stone and the casing.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
There, air currents moving with the turning stone continually
sweep the meal around to an opening in the floor
of the casing.</p>
<p>From this opening a chute leads downward to the sifting
device on the lower floor. The sifter, on the left side of
the mill as you look in from the platform, separates the
bran from the meal. The miller can bag each product almost
automatically, since the sifter, too, is constantly shaken by
an ingenious connection to the mill&rsquo;s driving mechanism.</p>
<p>The entire mill, thus, is about as simple a machine as
one could devise. The moving parts are few and could be
called primitively clumsy in comparison to some of the sleek
masterpieces of modern industrial design. The miller can
make only three operating adjustments: in the sail area
presented to the wind, in the rate of grain fed to the stones,
and in the distance between the stones. He has no control
over wind speed, cannot shift the gear ratio of the mill&mdash;or
even shift the stones out of gear&mdash;and, finally, cannot
determine his own hours of work and rest.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reader will be inclined to marvel a bit that
the product of such a mill is so good. And perhaps he
will look with some compassion on a man who is so completely
a slave to the elements. If some of the miller&rsquo;s
fellows have been disposed&mdash;on occasion&mdash;to take just a
trifle more toll than law and custom allow, well, let him
who is without fault cast the first stone. Millstone, that is.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
